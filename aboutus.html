            <p>Aaron and Belinda Ware are a married couple who decided to go camping for their health, only to return with clogged sinuses, itchy rashes, painful sunburn, and stomach ailments. They believed that getting away from the frantic environment of urban living was a good idea, but it isn't accessible for everyone. They decided a camping experience should be offered for people like them, but without camping. That's why they established <strong>Cautious Camping</strong>.</p>
            <p>Now open with locations in Georgia, New Jersey, and the Florida Everglades, with plans to open campsites on the west coast.</p>
